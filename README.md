__Assignment: Lab of numerical simulation__ <br>
__Bachelor's degree in physics (A.A 2018/2019)__

This repository includes all exercises assigned during the course held by professor Galli Davide Emilio.

Each folder has the following structure:
- Subfolders contain exercises written in C++. Each exercises is marked by a number. 
- A jupyter notebook with all observations and comments of the previous exercises. 
- Some slides about the main concepts. 

Each folder correspond to a lesson in which the following themes are described:

1. Pseudo-Random generator, statistical distribution, central limit theorem, Buffon's experiment (compuation of \pi).
2. Random walk.
3. Monte Carlo techniques for Black-Scholes theory.
4. Molecular dynamics: simulation of a system made up of N particles. The goal is the computation of thermodynamics properties of N particles, i.e. energy per particle, kinetic energy per particle, temperature and pressure. 
5. Metropolis algorithm for the computation of the radius of hydrogen wave function.
6. Simulation of Ising model.
7. More about thermodynamics properties of N particles. 
8. Variational Monte Carlo.
9. Genetic algorithm.
10. Simulated annealing techniques.
11. Machine learning introduction: play with some fully-connected neural network.
12. MNIST classification.
